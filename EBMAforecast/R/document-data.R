#' Sample data Presidential Election
#'
#' This includes the data for the presidential election forecasting example in Montgomery, Hollenbach and Ward (2012). The data ranges from 1952 to 2008 and includes predictions for the six different component models included in the Ensemble model. Users may split the sample into calibration and test sample.
#'
#' The variables included in the dataset are:
#' \itemize{
#' \item\code{Campbell} Predictions of Campbell's ``Trial-Heat and Economy Model'' (Campbell 2008).
#' \item\code{Abramowitz} Predictions of Abramowitz's ``Time for Change Model'' (Abramowitz 2008).
#' \item\code{Hibbs} Predictions for the ``Bread and Peace Model'' created by Douglas Hibbs (2008).
#' \item\code{Fair} Forecasts from Fair's presidential vote share model (2010).
#' \item\code{Lewis-Beck/Tien} Predictions from the ``Jobs Model Forecast''	by Michael Lewis-Beck and Charles Tien (2008).
#' \item\code{EWT2C2} Predictions from the model in Column 2 in Table 2 by Erickson and Wlezien (2008).
#' \item\code{Actual} The true values of the dependent variable, i.e. the incumbent-party voteshare in each presidential election in the sample.

#' Sample data Insurgency Predictions
#'
#' This includes the data for the predictions of insurgencies in 29 countries for 2010. 
#' 
#' The predictions included in the dataset are:
#' \itemize{
#' \item\code{LMER} Predictions from a generalized linear mixed effects model using a logistic link function and including a randomeffects term for lagged GDP per capita and the lagged number of conflictual events involving the United States in the country of interest. 
#' \item\code{SAE} Predictions from a one model developed as part of the ICEWS project and was designed by Strategic Analysis Enterprises.
#' \item\code{GLM} Predictions from a crude logistic model that includes only population size, GDP growth (both lagged 3 months), the number of minority groups at risk in the country, and a measure of anocracy supplied in the Polity IV data set.
#'}
#' More detail about each model can be found in Mongomery et al. (2012)
