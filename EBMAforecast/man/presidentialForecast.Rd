\description{
This includes the data for the presidential election forecasting example in Montgomery, Hollenbach and Ward (2012). The data ranges from 1952 to 2008 and includes predictions for the six different component models included in the Ensemble model. Users may split the sample into calibration and test sample.
}
\details{
The variables included in the dataset are:
\itemize{
\item\code{Campbell} Predictions of Campbell's ``Trial-Heat and Economy Model'' (Campbell 2008).
\item\code{Abramowitz} Predictions of Abramowitz's ``Time for Change Model'' (Abramowitz 2008).
\item\code{Hibbs} Predictions for the ``Bread and Peace Model'' created by Douglas Hibbs (2008).
\item\code{Fair} Forecasts from Fair's presidential vote share model (2010).
\item\code{Lewis-Beck/Tien} Predictions from the ``Jobs Model Forecast''	by Michael Lewis-Beck and Charles Tien (2008).
\item\code{EWT2C2} Predictions from the model in Column 2 in Table 2 by Erickson and Wlezien (2008).
\item\code{Actual} The true values of the dependent variable, i.e. the incumbent-party voteshare in each presidential election in the sample.
