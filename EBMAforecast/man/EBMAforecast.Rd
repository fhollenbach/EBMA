\description{
The EBMAforecast package allows users to increase the accuracy of forecasting models by pooling multiple component forecasts to generate ensemble forecasts. It includes functions to fit an ensemble Bayesian model averaging (EBMA) model using in-sample predictions, generate ensemble out-of-sample predictions, and create useful data visualizations.
Currently, the package can only handle dichotomous outcomes or those with normally distributed errors. Missing observation are allowed in the calibration set, but models with many predictions missing are penalized. EBMA models can be estimated using an EM algorithm or via gibbs sampling.
