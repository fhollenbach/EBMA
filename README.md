# EBMAforecast

=======


Overview
--------

The **EBMAforecast** package allows users to combine predictions from multiple models or entities in a principled manner based on the individual components predictive performance. The package provides methods to estimate ensemble Bayesian averaging models for binary and continuous outcomes via expectation maximization (EM) algorithm or gibbs sampling. The **EBMAforecast** package is largely based on Montgomery et al. (2012, 2015).
